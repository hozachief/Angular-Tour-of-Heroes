<!--
The template presents a grid of hero name links.
The *ngFor repeater creates as many links as are in the component's heroes array.
The links are styled as colored blocks by the dashboard.component.css.
The links don't go anywhere yet but they will shortly.

Now that the router has a route to HeroDetailComponent, fix the dashboard hero links
to navigate via the parameterized dashboard route.
You're using Angular interpolation binding within the *ngFor repeater to insert the
current iteration's hero.id into each routerLink.
